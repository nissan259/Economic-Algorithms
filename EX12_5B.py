# ------------------ EXPLANATION AND PROOF ------------------

print("""
------------------------------------------------------
Explanation and Proof of Correctness:

Let there be n citizens and m sections. Each citizen i submits a proposal vector p_i = (p_{i,1}, ..., p_{i,m}) such that the sum of each proposal equals the total budget C.

The efficient algorithm operates in two steps:
1. For each section j, compute the median value of all citizens’ proposals for that section.
2. If the sum of medians equals the total budget, use this allocation. If not, normalize the vector by scaling all medians proportionally so that the total equals the budget.

Why does this method provide a correct and fair allocation?

1. **Median Minimizes Absolute Loss:**  
   For each section j, the median minimizes the sum of absolute differences |d_j - p_{i,j}| over all i. This property ensures that the overall dissatisfaction (measured by absolute distance) is as low as possible for each section, given the citizens' proposals.

2. **Normalization Preserves Fairness:**  
   When the medians are independently chosen per section, their sum might not exactly match the required total budget. Scaling all values proportionally preserves the *relative* fairness determined by the medians, and strictly enforces the total budget constraint. This is equivalent to projecting the vector of per-section medians onto the simplex of allocations summing to C.

3. **Pareto Efficiency:**  
   The resulting allocation is Pareto efficient because, after normalization, it is impossible to improve the allocation for any section (making one citizen strictly closer to their ideal) without making at least one other citizen worse off. Any alternative allocation that improves at least one section’s median would necessarily worsen another (since the sum is fixed and the median is a minimizer of L1 loss).

**Limitation:**  
This approach is fully correct and Pareto efficient *when the aggregation rule does not require adding virtual (fixed) votes*, as in the basic median case. If the rule does require fixed votes (as in the generalized median with linear functions), this method is an efficient approximation but may not capture the exact theoretical allocation.

**Conclusion:**  
The efficient median-and-normalization algorithm produces a fair, Pareto-efficient allocation of the total budget across sections, matching both the collective centrality of citizen proposals and the required sum constraint.
